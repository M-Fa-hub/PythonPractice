Awesome. Here’s an intermediate-level OOP project that actually shows you know your stuff—without me handing you any code.

# Project: Smart Library Lending System (with Plugins)

## What you’ll build (at a glance)

A modular library system that tracks members, items (books, audiobooks, e-books), loans, reservations, fines, and notifications—with a plugin architecture for extra rules/features.

It’s big enough to be real, small enough to finish, and it forces you to use core OOP: abstraction, inheritance, composition, interfaces, design patterns, and clean boundaries. If you cut corners, it will show. If you do it right, it will look professional.

---

## Core domain model (classes you should have)

* **MediaItem (abstract)**
  Common interface for anything lendable. Concrete subclasses: `Book`, `EBook`, `AudioBook`.
  Include metadata, availability, and policy hooks (loan period, renewal policy).
* **Member (base)**
  Subclasses: `StudentMember`, `StaffMember`, `ExternalMember` with different borrowing limits & fine rules.
* **Loan**
  Represents an active or completed checkout. Knows start/end dates, renewals, state transitions.
* **Reservation / Waitlist**
  Queues by priority rules; auto-assigns item when returned.
* **Fine**
  Calculated via a strategy (per item type & member type). Supports aggregation, payment history.
* **Catalog / Repository**
  Search, list, and persistence layer (start with JSON/SQLite; your choice—but make it swappable).
* **NotificationCenter (observer)**
  Sends notifications (console/email stub) on events: due soon, overdue, reservation available.
* **Policy Engine**
  Pluggable rules (loan period, max items, grace days, renewals, fees). Load via a plugin system.
* **Command/Service layer**
  Use application services for use-cases: checkout, return, renew, reserve, payFine—so your UI stays thin.

## Key OOP goals (what to demonstrate)

* **Abstraction/Interfaces**: `MediaItem` as an abstract base + `@abstractmethod` for type-specific behavior.
* **Composition over inheritance**: A `Loan` *has* a `MediaItem` and a `Member`. A `Member` *has* a `FineAccount`.
* **Polymorphism**: Fine calculation and loan rules vary by item/member type via strategies.
* **Mixins (optional)**: e.g., `SearchableMixin`, `SerializableMixin` for cross-cutting behaviors.
* **Encapsulation with properties**: Validate state transitions (e.g., due dates, status) behind getters/setters.
* **Design patterns**:

  * Strategy (fine/loan rules)
  * Observer (notifications)
  * Factory (media creation from data source)
  * State (loan states: Active → Overdue → Closed)
  * Repository (persistence port)
* **MRO awareness**: If you use mixins, ensure consistent method order and document it.

---

## Functional scope (must-have)

* Add/list/search media items.
* Register members with different privileges.
* Checkout/return/renew items (enforce availability & limits).
* Reservations: place, cancel, auto-assign when available.
* Fines: compute on return/overnight job; allow payments; keep history.
* Notifications: due-soon, overdue, reservation-ready.
* Persistence: durable storage (start simple; keep swappable).

---

## Non-functional scope (your professionalism)

* **Clear module boundaries** (`domain/`, `services/`, `plugins/`, `infra/`, `ui/`).
* **Pluggable policies** (drop a file in `plugins/` to change rules—no core edits).
* **Config-driven** (loan durations, grace days, fine rates).
* **Logging & error handling** (domain errors vs infra errors).
* **Docstrings + concise README** (architecture diagram + decisions).

---

## Acceptance criteria (what “done” looks like)

* You can run scripted scenarios that prove:

  1. Member with limit hits refusal on checkout.
  2. Due-soon and overdue notifications fire at the right times.
  3. Reservation queue advances correctly when item is returned.
  4. Different member types yield different fines for the same late return.
  5. A plugin changes loan duration without touching core code.
  6. Persistence survives a restart (data intact).

Write these as high-level test stories first. If a story can’t be demonstrated end-to-end, you’re not done.

---

## Implementation roadmap (no code, just how to approach)

1. **Model the domain**
   Sketch classes, attributes, and relationships. Decide where abstraction is necessary vs premature.

2. **Define interfaces/ABCs**
   Lock the contracts for `MediaItem`, policy strategies, repositories, notification sinks.

3. **Build the domain first**
   Pure logic, in memory, no I/O. Prove the rules with unit tests against the domain only.

4. **Add services/use-cases**
   Orchestrate flows like checkout/return with transactions, validations, and domain events.

5. **Add persistence via repositories**
   Start with JSON or SQLite; the repository interface must not leak storage concerns to domain.

6. **Add notifications (observer)**
   Domain events → subscribers → notification center. Provide at least two channels (console + stub “email”).

7. **Add plugin system**
   Load policy strategies dynamically from a directory. Include one built-in policy and one plugin.

8. **Polish**
   Logging, config, help/usage docs, error messages that don’t insult the user.

---

## Suggested modules/folders

* `domain/` (entities, value objects, ABCs, policies, exceptions)
* `services/` (application services, coordinators)
* `infra/` (repositories, persistence, notification adapters, config, logging)
* `plugins/` (policy implementations discovered at runtime)
* `ui/` (CLI or minimal TUI; thin—no business logic)
* `tests/` (unit for domain, integration for services, scenario scripts)

---

## Data model (keep it pragmatic)

* **MediaItem**: id, title, authors, format, policy\_ref, status.
* **Member**: id, type, active\_loans, fine\_account.
* **Loan**: id, item\_id, member\_id, start\_date, due\_date, renewals, state.
* **Reservation**: id, item\_id, queue of member\_ids with timestamps.
* **Fine**: id, member\_id, amount, reason, created\_at, settled\_at.

---

## Stretch goals (if you have time)

* **Role-based access** (Librarian vs Member).
* **Import/export** (CSV/JSON bulk ops; validate and report errors).
* **Search** (filters, simple ranking).
* **Calendar-aware due dates** (skip weekends/holidays).
* **Web API** (swap the CLI with a tiny service—only if your core is clean).
* **Concurrency** (file/DB locking or optimistic checks) if you simulate multiple users.

---

## Red flags (don’t do this)

* Dumping all logic in the UI.
* Tight-coupling domain to the database (you’ll regret it when swapping storage).
* Overusing inheritance for “code reuse” (use composition).
* Silent failures—surface domain errors clearly.
* Writing code first, inventing requirements later. Do the opposite.

---

## How you’ll be judged (rubric)

* **OOP design**: clear responsibilities, correct use of abstraction/polymorphism, no god classes.
* **Extensibility**: can you add a policy without editing core?
* **Correctness**: workflows behave under normal and edge cases.
* **Tests**: domain tests are fast, deterministic, and meaningful.
* **Docs**: architecture overview + how to extend.

---

If you want, I can turn this into a checklist you can track task-by-task. And if you’d rather build a different domain (banking, inventory, or a task-runner with plugins), say the word—I’ll map the same rigor to that context.
